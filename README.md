### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 
I am Anupama and welcome to my GitHub page. I am from India and currently, I am an MSc. graduate from Technische Universitaet, Berlin and ELTE, Budapest. I specialise in Autonomous Systems.

### Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ± 
My interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. I am keen on topics that involve making sense of the scenes coming from different types of sensors. I have as much interest in traditional image processing and computer vision as in deep learning. I always marvel at how deep learning is capable of making sense from images but I also believe that, garbage in is garbage out and that's why I love pre-processing the images using traditional methods and algorithms.\
I love reading technical papers and try to implement and reproduce them as much as possible. Find implementations from some such papers in my 3D computer vision and sensor fusion repositories.\
I believe as a researcher, we should not be limited by our coding capabilities. Hence, I try to practise as much coding as I can in my free time. Although I like C and C++ more, I have been pushing myself out of my comfort zone to get more familiar with Python. General C++ and data structure algorithms and PyTorch tutoral and implementations can be found in my repositories 

### Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ”­ ...
A very interesting research topic that resonates with me, I am working on performing semantic segmentation on high-resolution satellite images to detect waste landfills. I am working on the project in association with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary and it is being supervised by Dr. Tamas Sziranyi and Dr. Andras Majdik.\
In the absence of a high resolution dataset catering to landfills, I have been working on creating and annotating my own dataset. Currently I am in the process of training various machine learning models and once benchmarked, I would be happy to make the dataset available for further use and development!
